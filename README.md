# Rock Paper Scissors React

One year after completing a RPS game in Angular for a tech test for OVO energy I'm am redoing the test to see what I would do differently.

## Planning

#### Basic Version
- uses local state in react
- game needs to allow the user to play rps aginst the computer and determine a winner
- logic must be unit tested
- styling

 #### Potential extras
- save running total of scores - use redux?
- style using styled components
- integration tests using Cypress

#### Components 
- game board
- weapons
- play again
- scoreboard

## To run Locally
